Its twisted trail leads passed broken and pillaged tombs and soon you enter a dark area. It's filled with tombs, some of which no longer hold their owner. What happened in this place? You carefully continue onwards, deeper into the dungeon's darkness. You pass various passages, most of which probably lead to other depths of this dungeon. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A big granite door blocks your path. Dire warning messages are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. did something just move behind this door?
A small fallen tree in a overcast grove marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the fallen tree lies a scanty, putrid room. It's covered in dead insects, dead vermin and large bones.

A wide dark cave in a grim thicket marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the dark cave lies a scanty, clammy room. It's covered in broken stone, ash and roots. Your torch allows you to see an altar, battered and spoiled by time itself. Further ahead are three paths, you take the left. Its twisted trail leads passed countless other pathways and soon you enter a foggy area. It's filled with strange glowing crystals and countless dead vermin. What happened in this place? You press onwards, deeper into the dungeon's secrets. You pass many different passages, each seem to go on forever, leading to who knows what. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room.

A modest graveyard in a sinister mountain range marks the entrance to this dungeon. Beyond the graveyard lies a scanty, dusty room. It's covered in broken pottery, rubble and rat droppings. Your torch allows you to see broken mining equipment, pillaged and mutilated by time itself. Further ahead is a single path.

What happened in this place? You carefully continue onwards, deeper into the dungeon's shadows. You pass a few more passages, some are dead ends, others lead to who knows where, or what. You eventually make it to what is likely the final room. A tall metal door blocks your path. Ominous symbols are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. you're pretty sure you're being watched.
